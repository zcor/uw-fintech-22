/*
1. Use the `latest_trade.sol` file to create a contract named `LatestTrade` that contains:

    * A string variable `coin` with the value `XRP` assigned to it.

    * An unsigned integer variable `price`.

    * A boolean variable `is_buy_order`.

2. Add a function named `updateTrade` to the `LatestTrade` contract as follows:

    * Define a in-memory string variable `new_coin` as the first parameter.

    * Define an unsigned integer variable `new_price` as the second parameter.

    * Define a boolean variable `is_buy` as the third parameter.

    * Into the body of the function, set the contract variables `coin`, `price`, and `is_buy_order` to the inputs of
      the `updateTrade` function. This function will update the contract variables via the `updateTrade` function.

3. Add a public getter function `getTrade` to the `LatestTrade` contract as follows.

    * The `getTrade` function should return the `coin`, `price`, and `is_buy_order` variables of the `LatestTrade`
      contract.
